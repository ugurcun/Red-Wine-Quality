# Red-Wine-Quality
In this project, we will work with the Red Wine Quality(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) dataset, which determines the quality of red wines according to their chemical properties. We will look at the chemical properties of red wines and try to create a model that gives them a quality score between 0 and 10.
